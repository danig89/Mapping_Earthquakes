# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. The objective was to traverse and retrieve GeoJSON earthquake data and tectonic plate data from the U.S. Geographical Survey website in order to populate a geographical map, using:
- javascript
- D3
- leaflet libraries

An API request was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map.
